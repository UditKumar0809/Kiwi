In Delhi's smog where the traffic crawls,
A Rajput stands tall within gym walls.
Calculus wiz with a heavy heart,
Watching his life (and RCB) fall apart.

She left for a guy with a boring job,
While you calculate angles and stifle a sob.
But listen Kiwi, don't shed a tear,
Christmas brings gains and holiday cheer!

So lift that weight, forget her face,
You're winning the Engineering race.
Santa knows you're a King, it's true,
(Even if Kohli doesn't know you).

Oye Kiwi (Mr. Rajput),

Merry Christmas from your Secret Santa!

I checked the Naughty List. You're on it. Why? Because you're still waiting for two impossible things:
1. RCB to win the trophy.
2. Your Ex to realize she lost a gem.

Look bhai, you're an Engineer in Delhi. You survive pollution, traffic, and teaching Math to kids who think 'X' is just an alphabet. You are a warrior. 

If she left, it's her loss. She couldn't handle the intensity of a man who can debug code, deadlift 100kg, and still has the patience to watch RCB lose every year. 

Focus on the grind. The jobs will come, the gains will come, and who knows... maybe one day Kohli will actually lift the cup (don't bet on it though).

Stay Chatpataa. Stay King.

"To Kiwi, 
They say Cricket is a gentleman's game, but Life plays rough. You've taken bouncers from your Ex and yorkers from Engineering, yet you're still standing at the crease. That's the Rajput spirit. 
Remember: Trophies gather dust, but the strength you build—in the gym and in your character—lasts forever. Keep swinging the bat. Your century is inevitable."
